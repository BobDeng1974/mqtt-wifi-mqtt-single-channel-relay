*Unfortnatly the source code and CAD design is not available for this unit. However the unit is very similar to the open-source [Three Channel MQTT Relay](https://github.com/mharizanov/ESP8266_Relay_Board) that we have [adapted to work in single channel mode](https://github.com/openenergymonitor/ESP8266_Relay_Board).*
